# Titanic-Ship-Survival-Prediction-Project

#### By **Ted Askoye Samuel**

## Description
Titanic was a  British luxury passenger liner that sank on April 14th â€“ 15th, 1912, during its maiden voyage, en route to New York City from Southampton, England, killing about 1,500  passengers and ship personnel. One of the most famous tragedies in modern history and has been the subject of much scholarship and scientific speculation. Using the K-Nearest Neighbours Classifier and given a number of features, we will predict whether a passenger onboard the Titanic survived the shipwreck.

## Experimental Design


* Randomly partition each dataset into two parts i.e 80 - 20 sets because we don't have the label for the test set. We will use the train set to create train and test data (i.e. splitting further), then perform K-nearest neighbor classification.

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* Google colab
* Python basics
* Python libraries (Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Scikit learn)
* Github
